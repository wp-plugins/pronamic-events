Pronamic Events is a basic plugin to add some Events functionality.


== Description ==

= Gravity Forms =

With [Gravity Forms](http://www.gravityforms.com/) and the [Gravity Forms + Custom Post Types](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/gravity-forms-custom-post-types/)
you can create an form to create event posts. In most cases you also want to automatic fill in the event start date, end date 
and location. You can set this up by checking one of the options on the date/time fields.

*	Is Event Start Date
*	Is Event Start Time
*	Is Event End Date
*	Is Event End Time

For the other fields you can add Custom Fields from the Post Fields 
section and give them the correct custom field names:

*	Location - Field Type = Text, Name = _pronamic_location
*	Website - Field Type = Website, Name = _pronamic_event_url
